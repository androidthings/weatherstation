Android Things Weather Station sample
=====================================

This sample shows integration of multiple Android Things peripheral to build a connected Weather Station.

Pre-requisites
--------------
- Android Things compatible board
- Android Studio 2.2+
- [Rainbow Hat for Android Things](https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/rainbow-hat-for-android-things) or the following individual components:
    - 1 [bmp280 temperature sensor](https://www.adafruit.com/product/2651)
    - 1 [segment display with I2C backpack](https://www.adafruit.com/product/1270)
    - 1 push button
    - 1 resistor
    - jumper wires
    - 1 breadboard
    - (optional) 1 [APA102 compatible RGB Led strip](https://www.adafruit.com/product/2241)
    - (optional) 1 [Piezo Buzzer](https://www.adafruit.com/products/160)
    - (optional) [Google Cloud Platform](https://cloud.google.com/) project

Schematics
----------

If you have the Raspberry Pi [Rainbow Hat for Android Things](https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/rainbow-hat-for-android-things), just plug it onto your Raspberry Pi 3.

Build and install
=================
On Android Studio, click on the "Run" button.
If you prefer to run on the command line, type
```bash
./gradlew installDebug
adb shell am start com.example.androidthings.weatherstation/.WeatherStationActivity
```

If you have everything set up correctly:
- The segment display will show the current temperature.
- If the button is pressed, the display will show the current pressure.
- If a Piezo Buzzer is connected, it will plays a funny sound on startup.
- If a APA102 RGB Led strip is connected, it will display a rainbow of 7 pixels indicating the current pressure.
- If a Google Cloud Platform project is configured (see instruction below), it will publish the sensor data to Google Cloug PubSub.

Google Cloud Platform configuration (optional)
==============================================
0. Go to your project in the [Google Cloud Platform console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
0. Under *API Manager*, enable the following APIs: Cloud Pub/Sub
0. Under *IAM & Admin*, create a new Service Account, provision a new private key and save the generated json credentials.
0. Under *Pub/Sub*: create a new topic and in the *Permissions* add the service account created in the previous step with the role *Pub/Sub Publisher*.
0. Under *Pub/Sub*: create a new *Pull subscription* on your new topic.
0. Import the project into Android Studio. Add a file named `credentials.json` inside `app/src/main/res/raw/` with the contents of the credentials you downloaded in the previous steps.
0. In `app/build.gradle`, replace the `buildConfigField` values with values from your project setup.

After running the sample, you can check that your data is ingested in Google Cloud Pub/Sub by running the following command:
```
gcloud --project <CLOUD_PROJECT_ID> beta pubsub subscriptions pull <PULL_SUBSCRIBTION_NAME>
```

Note: If there is no `credentials.json` file in `app/src/main/res/raw`, the app will
 run offline and will not send sensor data to the [Google Cloud Pub/Sub](https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/).

Next steps
==========

Now your weather sensor data is continuously being published to [Google Cloud Pub/Sub](https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/):
- process weather data with [Google Cloud Dataflow](https://cloud.google.com/dataflow/) or [Google Cloud Functions](https://cloud.google.com/functions/)
- persist weather data in [Google Cloud Bigtable](https://cloud.google.com/bigtable/) or [BigQuery](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/)
- create some weather visualization with [Google Cloud Datalab](https://cloud.google.com/datalab/)
- build weather prediction model with [Google Cloud Machine Learning](https://cloud.google.com/ml/)
